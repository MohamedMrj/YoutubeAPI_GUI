## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of the project is to help users getting information such as Youtube Channel ID and/or Youtube Video Information such as comments count, views count and even likes count. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
- Install Python 3.11 or above
- Install requests (pip install requests)
- Install tkinter (pip install tk) more info here (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-tkinter-in-python)
- Import json (import json)
- Install pytube (pip install pytube) more info here (https://pytube.io/en/latest/user/install.html)
- Grab your API Key from https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Make sure to have Python 3.11 or above.

```
Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
```

Install requests

```
Requests is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library
Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There‚Äôs no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your PUT & POST data ‚Äî but nowadays, just use the json method!

Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around 30M downloads / week‚Äî according to GitHub, Requests is currently depended upon by 1,000,000+ repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.

You can install it by:

pip install requests
or 
python -m pip install requests
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
